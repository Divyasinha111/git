//it has two types 
//1. synchronous 
//2. Synchronous 

/*synchronous callback functions execute instantly, but asynchronous callback functions 
executes at a later TimeRanges.*/

/*asynchronus callback funcrtion execution is random but in synchronous callback function
 it will executes first one which will go first*/

 //Importance of callback
 /*1. you can use them to send asynchronous API.
 2. you can use them to enhance your codes performance.
 3. Higher-order functions
 4.it manages the flow of asynchronous operation , preventing the infamous "callback hell".
